<h1>F.A.Q</h1>

<h2>Why no cooldowns on the rituals?</h2>
I don't like cooldowns on stuff, the material cost is enough.

<h2>Balanced?</h2>
I'd say so, the stronger rituals are expensive in terms of shards or have their own risks.

<h2>CE compat?</h2>
Yes.

<h2>Safe to add/remove mid-game?</h2>
Yes.
